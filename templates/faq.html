<h1>FAQ</h1>


<h3>What is this site?</h3>
<p>
Diddy-Donation is specifically for really small donations (1p/&pound;0.01) that you give to a webpage if you find it interesting, useful or fun.
</p>


<h3>What is the point of such a small donation?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A 1p donation is such a small commitment that you don't need to justify it to yourself - just do it!</li>
<li>It's a great way to show your support for a website - Put your money where your mouth is!</li>
<li>We believe it's more likely for 1000 people to donate 1p than it is for 1 person to donate 10 pounds.</li>
<li>It's not just about the money - If a author has recieved 500 1p pledges they will be encourgaged to continue what they are doing.</li>
<li>Life is a marathon, not a sprint. Websites can benefit from a tiny trickle of small donations because they all add up.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Why should I use diddydonation.com?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Free service - no fees. We don't take a slice of the pie.</li>
<li>Zero commitment - Donations are <abbr title="I Owe You (a.k.a. a pledge)">IOUs</abbr> rather than confirmed, i.e you can make a whole bunch of pledges before you need to put your money where your mouth is. Actually, you're never committed to pay, unless you want to.</li>
<li>We are open and transparent. e.g. see our sourcecode here, and see our balance sheets here</li>
<li>You can pledge to any website, you don't have to wait for the website to set up a donations box. Until they have given details on how to get funds to their bank, your dontations can only be <abbr title="I Owe You (a.k.a. a pledge)">IOUs</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
